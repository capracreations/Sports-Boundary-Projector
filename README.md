A projector capable of displaying boundary lines for a multitude of sports using masks.

## Requirements
### Softwares
- CAD Software (Solidworks, Fusion360, Onshape)
- 3D-printing slicer (Cura, Prusaslicer)
### Equipment
- 3D-printer
- 4kg PETG filament, black
- 14,000lm 12/24V floodlight
- f = 100mm Fresnel Lens (d = 100mm)
- f = 200mm Convex Lens (d = 100mm)
- M.# threaded inserts (verious sizes)

## Procedure
Download all the .stl CAD files and print them out with a black filament with a printer of your choice. Use 0.2mm quality to save time for the larger prints and between 0.1mm and 0.2mm for the smaller parts for greater precision. Please refer to the pictures in this repo for assembly.
